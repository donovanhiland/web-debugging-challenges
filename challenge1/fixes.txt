Fix #1: in app.js the controller linked to the settings route was typo'd. Instead of settingsCtrl it was settingsctrl.

Fix #2: there was a closing curly bracket missing in productsCtrl on line 10

Fix #3: app.js states were missing brackets and structured incorrectly. Originally they were structured as

".state('routeName') {
    routeInfo
}"

The correct structure is:

".state('routeName', {
  routeInfo
})"

.state takes in a routename string, and an object with routeOptions separated by a comma.

Fix #4: The ui router dependency in app.js was incorrectly spelled ui-router instead of ui.router. Period not hyphen.

Fix #5: added otherwise to routes

Fix #6: script tag wasn't closed in index file when bringing in angular ui router. My syntax theme screwed me over on this one. I spent almost the entire hour looking but I couldn't see any difference because all my text is green.
